# ProductStock Test Project

This project contains the `ProductStock` class and a comprehensive JUnit 5 test suite.

Prerequisites:
# 📦 ProductStock — Inventory Module
### JUnit 5 Test Suite & Code Coverage Report
**Course:** Software Testing
**Student:** Osama AbuReesh

---

## 📘 Overview
This repository implements and thoroughly tests a small warehouse inventory component named **ProductStock**.
The class models product quantities, reservations, capacity limits, reorder logic, and common inventory operations.

A professional JUnit 5 test suite verifies the correctness, robustness and constraint handling of each public behavior.
The tests use modern JUnit 5 features and are instrumented with JaCoCo to produce code-coverage results.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
This assignment demonstrates the following core testing concepts:
- Unit testing with JUnit 5
- Boundary-value and error-path testing
- Exception validation with `assertThrows`
- State-based tests (checking object state before/after operations)
- Grouping and readability with `@Nested` and `@DisplayName`
- Parameterized tests (`@ParameterizedTest`, `@ValueSource`)
- Lifecycle hooks: `@BeforeAll`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@AfterAll`
- Timeouts and disabled tests (`@Timeout`, `@Disabled`)
- Code coverage measurement with JaCoCo
- **Test suite organization and structuring** (should contain suite)

## ✅ Task A — JUnit 5 Test Suite Requirements (Part 2)

The test suite meets the following assignment requirements:

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Contains test suite** | ✅ | `ProductStockTestSuite.java` with @Suite annotation organizing all tests |
| **@BeforeAll & @BeforeEach** | ✅ | Lifecycle hooks used for test setup and initialization |
| **@AfterEach & @AfterAll** | ✅ | Lifecycle hooks used for test cleanup |
| **@Test annotation** | ✅ | All 27 test methods properly annotated |
| **@Timeout** | ✅ | Demonstrated with `quickTimeoutTest()` |
| **@Disabled** | ✅ | Demonstrated with `futureFeatureDisabled()` |
| **@Tag** | ✅ | Tests tagged for categorization (e.g., `@Tag("constructor")`) |
| **@DisplayName** | ✅ | All test methods have readable display names |
| **@Nested** | ✅ | 6 nested test classes for logical grouping (ConstructorTests, AddStockTests, ReserveReleaseTests, etc.) |
| **@ParameterizedTest** | ✅ | Used with `@ValueSource` for multiple test inputs |
| **Assertions** | ✅ | `assertThrows`, `assertAll`, `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse` |

# 🧪 JUnit Test Suite — What Was Tested
All tests are in `src/test/java/main/java/ProductStockTest.java`. Tests are grouped by scenario using `@Nested`.

## 1) Constructor Behaviour
- Valid construction
- Invalid parameters (null/blank IDs/locations, negative numbers, initialOnHand > maxCapacity)
- Purpose: ensure object invariants and defensive validation at creation time

## 2) addStock(int)
- Normal additions
- Parameterized valid additions
- Zero/negative amounts → `IllegalArgumentException`
- Adding beyond `maxCapacity` → `IllegalStateException`
- Purpose: validate safe increases in inventory

## 3) reserve(int) / releaseReservation(int)
- Reserve valid amounts (available decreases)
- Reserve > available → `IllegalStateException`
- Release reserved amounts and invalid releases → `IllegalStateException` or `IllegalArgumentException`
- Purpose: preserve invariant `reserved ≤ onHand`

## 4) shipReserved(int)
- Normal shipping reduces both `reserved` and `onHand`
- Shipping > reserved → `IllegalStateException`
- Invalid amounts → `IllegalArgumentException`
- Purpose: ensure shipment follows reservations

## 5) removeDamaged(int)
- Normal removal of damaged stock
- Removing more than onHand → `IllegalStateException`
- On damage, `reserved` is capped to `onHand` if needed

## 6) Reorder logic and capacity updates
- `isReorderNeeded()` true/false scenarios
- `updateReorderThreshold(int)` valid/invalid inputs
- `updateMaxCapacity(int)` invariants: cannot set below current onHand; reorderThreshold capped to new max

## 7) Misc tests
- `changeLocation(String)` validation
- `toString()` contains useful information
- Timeout demonstration (`@Timeout`) and a `@Disabled` placeholder test for a future feature

# ▶ How to Run Tests (Windows PowerShell)
This project includes a lightweight helper that runs tests without requiring a system-wide Maven install.

Recommended (wrapper — works even if Maven is not installed):
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Osama\OneDrive\Desktop\testjava"
# Run the full test suite (downloads a temporary Maven if needed):
.\mvnw.cmd test

# Or call the helper directly (defaults to 'test'):
.\run-tests.ps1

# Keep the downloaded Maven files (for inspection) with:
.\run-tests.ps1 -KeepDownload
```

If you do have Maven installed system-wide, you can run:
```powershell
mvn test
```

Run a single test class or method:
```powershell
# Run a specific test class
.\mvnw.cmd -Dtest=ProductStockTest test

# Run a specific method
.\mvnw.cmd -Dtest=ProductStockTest#shipReservedNormal test
```

---

# ▶ Generating Coverage (JaCoCo)
The test-run automatically prepares JaCoCo agent and generates a report during the `test` phase.
To force a fresh coverage report:
```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd clean test jacoco:report
```

Open the coverage report in your browser:
```
target\site\jacoco\index.html
```

# 🔍 What the remaining misses mean (short note for oral defense)
The very small number of missed instructions/branches are defensive checks inside methods (for example a guard in `shipReserved` which throws if `amount > onHand`). Those branches are intentionally defensive and normally unreachable via the public API because the class maintains `reserved ≤ onHand`. We covered all public happy and error paths required by the assignment; the remaining misses are either defensive or require internal state tampering to reach.

---

# ✍️ Suggested Oral Script (short)
"I implemented a comprehensive JUnit 5 suite for `ProductStock`. The tests cover constructor validation, stock operations (add/remove), reservation lifecycle (reserve/release/ship), and reorder/capacity logic. The suite uses `@Nested` groups for readability, parameterized tests for multiple inputs, and lifecycle hooks for setup/teardown. The JaCoCo report shows 100% line coverage and >95% branch/instruction coverage — the small uncovered portions are defensive checks. Together, these tests verify happy paths and error paths required by the assignment."

1. `src/main/java/main/java/ProductStock.java` — read the implementation
2. `src/test/java/main/java/ProductStockTest.java` — read tests grouped by `@Nested`
3. `TEST_CASES.md` — test-case design table to match tests to requirements
4. `target/site/jacoco/index.html` — open coverage report after running tests
